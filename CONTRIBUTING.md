# Contributing to Data Synthesis for Machine Learning

You are welcome to contribute code to the Data Synthesis for Machine Learning in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and **accept the Developer Certificate of Origin**. This is common practice in major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using *[CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)* for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click experience for accepting the CLA. For company contributors, special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they submit the first pull request to this projects, this happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).

## How to report an issue
If you find a bug, you are welcome to report it. Just create a new issue in our repository and give the detailed description and reproduce steps.

## Issue handling process
When an issue is reported, we will look at it and either confirm it as a real issue (by giving the "in progress" label), close it if it is not an issue, or ask for more details. In-progress issues are then assigned to a committer in GitHub. An issue that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed.
